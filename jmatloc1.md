I am Reagan Matlock and I am a MSBA student here at UTK. 
I graduated undergrad in 2017 in Business Analytics and worked for 3 years in a food Distribution company before deciding to return for my MSBA. 
I like sports and the outdoors. 
I believe I am a detail oriented person which comes out in my schooling as well as other aspects of my life.
